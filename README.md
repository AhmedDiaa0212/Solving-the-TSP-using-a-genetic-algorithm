# Solving-the-TSP-using-a-genetic-algorithm
This project employs a genetic algorithm to solve The Traveling Salesman Problem "TSP", which is the task of finding the shortest route that passes through a given set of cities. The algorithm initializes a population of candidate solutions and improves them through selection, crossover, and mutation operations to obtain better solutions.
